**Which races live in this world?** 
Mostly “classic” races such as Elves, Dwarfs, Gnomes, Halflings, but mostly Humans. Because the world is quite new, there were never wild experiments or procreation between different species. Other races do exist but are rare. Common people tend to approach those rare races with ease. There are also Goblins and Orcs, some good, some mean. They reside far away from the capitals. People know of their existence and don’t fear them. There were battles a long time ago and the goblins lost. Everyone lives in peace.

**Where would these races build settlements and why?** 
Civilizations were firstly built around water where people soon realized there was an infinite supply of food. Later when The Drought began, fish started to die, making it harder to get food.

**What is the overall theme of the world? High Fantasy? Post-apocalyptic? Grim and gritty? Other?** 
Fantasy/High/Medieval

**What races are included?** 
Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Half-Elf, Gnome, Halflings Human, Tiefling, Orc, Half-Orc, Goliath, Firbolg, Goblin, Kobolds, Githyanki. Other races not mentioned here are not “excluded” per say (like the Dragonborns), but it has never been seen in the world.

**Where do these races live?** 
Goliath, Firbolg live in the Anu’Kir Mountains (in the North Pole of the planet), Goliaths in the medium to big size town and Firbolgs in the forests. They used to live in towns not in the mountains but towns that were actually in cold areas, and the drought happened and they had to move to the poles of the planet to remain cold. Goblins, Kobolds live in the depths of the deserts, but that’s what people say. Githyanki are rarely seen.

**What's the magic, science and technology levels? High, middle, low, none?**

**How much history does the world have?** 
Earth has about 5000 years of modern history, for comparison. The world is 371 years old. The year is now 148aE. The Drought started in 47aE. The planet has been here for more than 371 years, but there was AN EVENT in 621bE (before the Defiance) that changed something and the population started counting again from 0.

**What is the economic engine? Gold-standard? Silver-standard? Barter?** 
The economic engine is Silver-standard. The world has silver and copper as currency. Rumor has it that there’s a more valuable coin known as Gold, its yellow-ish shiny color is said to blind your sight, but no one has yet to see someone with that coin.

**How much of the world is known to the civilizations who live there? Will there be maps? If so - how much detail will be on them? A lot, some or none?** 
There is still a lot of world to be discovered by the civilizations, the world is rather new, only been about for 300 years, and everything seems dangerous at first. The maps may not correspond exactly to what the world looks like because it’s only done by cartographers and adventurers that tell what they saw. Maybe whoever rules doesn’t want some places to be told to people because there’s something happening there, maybe it's sacred or it's dangerous.

**What's the most common form of travel? Is travel easy or difficult?** 
Mostly by horses and carriages. And boats for sea travel.

**What is the calendar like? 12-months? Or something else?** 
Each “year” on the calendar is 9 months. Each month has 21 days, every third month there are 15 days. Before there was the Drought, there were 3 seasons: Summer, Rain,  Wind. Summer was 2 months, Rain 2 more, Wind was 3 months.
