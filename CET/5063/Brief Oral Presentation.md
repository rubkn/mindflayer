Good morning, I'm going to talk a little bit about my classmate Roberta. She was born on the 7th of July in 1984, and she is 40 years old. She is currently living in Montijo. She has a degree in public administration from Brazil, but it is not recognized here in Portugal. She has worked in Brazil but never in Portugal. She considers her English level to be a 3. She has three children, so in her free time, she spends a lot of time with her family, watching TV shows and movies. She also likes to hang out with friends, and she enjoys studying Italian. In one word, she describes herself as persistent.
