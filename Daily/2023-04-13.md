Finished task [2322](https://bt.appx.pt/view.php?id=2322) today. Feels good. Wrote good code, but there's always room for improvement. Feel like next tasks will be way easier given that it's only visual changes and such. Would love to start off by implementing Tailwind in the project but it's using such old technologies that I don't even know if it can be built into it.
