Today was alright, made some progress on the **bank and billing details** task. Will have to discuss with Miguel the IBAN input because that's just a huge work ahead of me. Either that or I just shut up and do it, but honestly I don't even know where to begin with that one.

Goals for tomorrow is to get the IBAN working, and the whole card working, including the selected properties and changes to the modal. Would be nice to have the add more bank details logic part working, there's some bug where the button doesn't appear.
