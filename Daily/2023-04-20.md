Lunch time. So far so good. Bank and billing details is looking sharp. 
I think I can have it done by the end of the day. (the visual at least)

15:06
Back from lunch. Tried to call Pedro from the shop to know more about the car but no answer. Called twice. Have to try again later.

Still at the office. This is nice.
Huge progress today. Went from shit to good.
There's still stuff missing, the bug on the add another details is still happening.
Need to get the property image for the affected properties modal.
