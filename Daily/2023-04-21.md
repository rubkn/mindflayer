Have to fix the affected properties modal. It opens but closes automatically, I think it's because of the loading state or something that triggers the close when it's not loading anymore.

Fixed the modal problem. Something related to the button tag. Ended up having to change it to `<button type="button" />`

Actually great progress today. Debugging and small tweaks that will ease my life in the upcoming days and tasks because I can just come back to this one and see how I did it.
Still a bug ongoing, yet to see what it's about.

Next big thing would be implementing a Modal component. Fuck Dialog. Fuck Material UI.

About to finish for the day. ChatGPT can help.
Lasting error: cannot read properties of undefined, reading 'some'.

Fix it.
Bye.
