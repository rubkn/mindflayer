First entry today. Not great progress. Can't figure out what's wrong with the task.
Basically at the moment I have the `affectedProperties` that are a copy of the `landlordProperties` but with the key property `isAffected` which initiates at `false`, but I got a `useEffect` that copies the all the landlord's properties and makes it into the affected ones with that changed property.

Thing is, where I really need to change is the data/info I think...
