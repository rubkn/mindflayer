Single update today. Morning wasn't very productive. Felt a little sick.
After lunch started to think better, late afternoon actually got productive and code is pretty stable now. There's a thing that's missing tho which is the affected properties aren't being connected between the forms so if I select one in the default form, it won't be disabled in the next form. Gotta fix that.

Things to do tomorrow:
- Analyse the tasks from AppX to see if the expenses can be reduced;
- Talk with Miguel about the e-mail design, there's the name missing;
- Finish the damn task!
