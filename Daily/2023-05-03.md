What a great day today was. Finished `Pagination` and the date filters is pretty close to being finished. Initial task was supposed to be 2 hours but I didn't know better. Code was all messed up, pagination didn't work, nor did the filters!! Can you believe this? How in the world does a developer, or better yet, a team of developers, push a feature without it working properly? This is what tests are for. Unfortunately, there's none.
