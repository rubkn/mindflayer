Not much progress today.
Thoughts on the current task and what I did and must change for it to work properly.

What's done today is not correct, the current two radio buttons render the same AvailabilitySlots child component, and whenI click the other radio button it just renders a new component and forgets any data that I had previously added on that first component for the other radio button value. So this needs to be fixed.

And after that, which is the major bug fix that I'm facing, I also need to pass the property "type" inside of the object, which is not passing through currently.
