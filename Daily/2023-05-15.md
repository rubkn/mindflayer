Been a while since I wrote.
Basically last week I finally had some progress on the move-in move-out feature task. Thing is, there's still a fix to be made on the `onSubmit` function in the RoomPrices component because currently I think it's duplicating the availabilities. I'll get it done soon.

Today didn't do much. But did enough to notice how fucked up the Next migration from AppX was. Not a single deprecated function. Next has built-in router and query parameters and they're still using vanilla shit. It's so bad. Sometimes I just wanna get out of this project. It's so dirty. Whenever I grab a new task in a new component that I haven't touched I get dizzy. Only times I'm productive is on components I've already seen and know to work my way around the crazyness of the spaghetti code that's going on.

We'll see... I love Next, I hate AppX.
