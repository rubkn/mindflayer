Enough for today.
Gonna play a bit. Try minecraft speedrunning!

About work, well, I did some updates on search.
Code is awful, instead of using flexbox they're using classnames like "top" and "bottom", who the fuck does this?? Jesus. About the property page, I think it's pretty doable actually. Maybe the part that will be more difficult will be the calendar and pre-fill the dates.
