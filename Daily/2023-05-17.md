Meeting with Manuel and Miguel about the Availabilities Slots, again...

Change to checkboxes instead of radio buttons to allow the Landlord to add both as it wishes. But maybe it would be best to have a Select inside the component.

Speak with Laura to figure out if the backend is accepting the move-in and move-out periods when the type is `period`.

Change move-in date and move-out date when it's type `period`. And remove year.
Add all availabilities to the right side container.

When it's period it's supposed to allow the Landlord to add a move-in period AND a move-out period. Meaning the Landlord could add 1 Fev - 15 Fev and 1 Sep - 15 Sep and the user searching for a room to enter in 3 Fev and to leave at 10 Sep would find this house.

Handler onClick to the availabilities cards on the right side scrolling to the availabilities.
Limit Landlord to 5 availabilities. Total.

Availabilities to every year. Data migration needed?
