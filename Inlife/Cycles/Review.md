- powerpoint com sprint review title, muy bien
- claro, "ciclos com base em scrum" - not a shapeup cycle!
- story 1: breadcumbs, SEO for the search page, domain merge
- story 2: flexible dates, to be added flexibility to +move-in date
- story 3: app finally on our side, still some bugs on visit request, infinite login load...
- story 4: radar, min, important dev, everything was ok, filters also
- story 5: booking status changes, sub-status, as in rejected but *rejected by what*?
- next steps: "reviews" process. I asked: what happens when the landlords say they don't want to show reviews less than 4 instead of less than 3? they answered: that's not for the landlord to decide.... OH REALLY?!? landlord asks prepaid bookings they get pre paid bookings, landlords ask for fixed move in dates, we develop fixed move in dates....
