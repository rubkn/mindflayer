Finished task [2322](https://bt.appx.pt/view.php?id=2322) today. Started to look at the possible next tasks, it's going to be a major design overhaul so mostly frontend. Given the [[Inlife Frontend List of Changes]] it appears to be a two month job (at max). Would love to implement Tailwind while I'm at it, but have to talk with AppX.

There's also this [[Improving Inlife Frontend Tasks]] for more organization. Some of these implementations might actual need some big code changes such as *My Calendar* for sure, and possibly *Radar* as well.
