Jos√© is not here but Laura is.

Update on my end is Landlord side is mostly done, I'm just awaiting the Laura date formats and then apply it to the code. Same with Students. 

Laura finished cancellation task. Explained the issue with elastic and the block it originated to the move-in and move-out dates.
