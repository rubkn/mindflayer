Meeting over, all the tasks discussed on [[Frontend x UXUI]]. 
Main goal is to finish before going on vacation, 13rd of August. 

Turns out *My Calendar* is not going to be implemented at this time, but there's lot of work with other big tasks such as *Radar* and all the *Make Offer* modal steps. Scary. I can do it.
