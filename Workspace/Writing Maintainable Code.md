As a developer, I know that understanding someone else's code can be a challenge. And that's exactly what I’m facing with the codebase developed by AppX. The code is complex, with poor documentation, not well structured, and it isn’t clear how to make changes or improvements without risking breaking everything.

Despite these challenges, I know that I have to find a way to work with this codebase and improve it for the long-term success of our projects. So, I’m setting out to understand the code, its design, and its limitations. As I’m working on it, I’m realizing that the code isn’t following best practices, and there is a lot of room for improvement.

In this research paper, I'll share my journey of understanding and improving the codebase. I'll explore the principles of good software design and best practices, and show how I’ll apply these to the existing code. I'll also describe the changes I’m making to the code to make it more maintainable, extensible, and reliable.

Ultimately, my goal is to provide a blueprint for anyone who inherits this codebase, and show that with the right mindset and tools, it's possible to turn a complex, messy codebase into a robust and reliable system that can grow and evolve over time.
